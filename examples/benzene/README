Example: benzene B3LYP/def2-TZVP

- Integration over a bond 
    - J, Jmod, ACID
- 3D cube files and VTK vti files
    - JVEC, JMOD, ACID
    - JVEC as vector and 3D streamline
    - ACID as surface
    - paraview examples see files.pvsm 
    - open paraview, load pvsm file 
    - paraview needs files.vti as input information
    - note ALL vti files contain data in atomic units
      therefore you need to convert the mol.xyz file from Angstroem
      to bohr
    - note this is not the case for the cube files
- 2D VTK vti file for JVEC
    - visualization as vectors and streamlines LIC
