#         VMD procedure to draw the integration planes      #
#           Add the code to the .vimrc file                 #
#    		USAGE: intplanes 8 		 	    #
#	where 8 is the number of opened grid files          #
#############################################################

# When you do current profiles you might want to see them drawn clearly 
# Perform a dry run on the first and last input files, so as to obtain the grid.xyz files for the two ends. 
# Remember to copy the grid.xyz to a backup file, because the next dry run will overwrite it.
# Then you can replace the coordinates of the first two atoms X from one of the grid.xyz file to the other. 
# The atoms X are the corners of the integration plane.
# The resulting grid.xyz file can then be opened in VMD. 
# To call the script, click Extensions from the main window and then select Tk Console.

#   NOTE!
#   Make sure that the IDs of the molecules start from 0 and are consecutive
#   For example, if you opened one molecule, then one more but deleted it, and then opened a third one, the script will not work
#   I hate it but at the moment I don't have the time to figure out how to fix it
