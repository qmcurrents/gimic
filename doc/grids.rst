Grids
=====

There are three possible grid topologies in gimic: 'std (or base)' which is
3-dimensional (although the extend in one direction may be zero), 'bond' which
is 2-dimensional, and 'file' which is an arbitrary set of points read from a
file. 'std' grids are especially useful for visualisations of an entire current
vector field. 'bond' grid are used to integrate the current that flows through
the grid.

For an 'std' or 'bond' grid one can specify the spacing (type) of points in
each dimension. The choices are 'even' for an equidistant grid, 'gauss' for a
Gauss grid and 'lobatto' for a Gauss-Lobatto grid.  The recommended choices are
'even' for 'std' and 'gauss' for 'bond'.  When a quadrature grid is specified
the order of the quadrature must also be specified with the ’gauss\_order’
keyword. The number of grid points in each direction is specified either
explicitly using either of the array keywords ’grid\_points’ or ’spacing’. If
the chosen grid is not a simple even spaced grid, the actual number of grid
points will be adjusted upwards to fit the requirements of the chosen
quadrature.

The shape of the grid can also be modified by the ’radius’ key, which
specifies a cutoff radius. This can be useful for integration. Sometimes
it’s practical to be able to specify a grid relative to a well know
starting point. The ’rotation’ keyword specifies Euler angles for
rotation according to the x->y->z convention. Note that the magnetic
field is not rotated, unless it is specified with ’magnet\_axis=i,j or
k’.

GIMIC automatically outputs a number of .xyz files containing dummy
points to show how the grids defined actually are laid out in space.

Basic grids
-----------

The ’std’ grid is defined by giving an ’origin’ and two orthogonal basis
vectors ’ivec’ and ’jvec’ which define a plane. The third axis is
determined from :math:`\vec k=\vec i\times\vec j`. The array ’lengths’
specifies the grid dimensions in each direction.

      in the x->y->z convention.

Bond grids
----------

The ’bond’ type grids define a plane through a bond, or any other
defined vector. The plane is orthogonal to the vector defining the bond.
The bond can be specified either by giving two atom indices,
’bond=[1,2]’, or by specifying a pair of coordinates, ’coord1’ and
’coord2’. The position of the grid between two atoms is determined by
the ’distance’ key, which specifies the distance from atom 1 towards
atom 2. For analysing dia- and paramagnetic contributions, the positive
direction of the bond is taken to be from atom 1 towards atom 2. Since
one vector is not enough to uniquely defining the coordinate system
(rotations around the bond are arbitrary), a fixpoint must be specified
using either the ’fixpoint’ atom index or the ’fixcoord’ keyword. This
triple of coordinates is also used to fix the direction of the magnetic
field when the ’magnet\_axis=T’ is used.

The shape and size of the bond grid is specified by the keywords 'width' and
'height'.  Each of the four components is relative to a point on the line
connecting the two reference atoms/coordinates.  Typically (but not
necessarily) the first component of both ranges is negative and the second
component is positive.
