Example: benzene B3LYP/def2-TZVP

- Integration over a bond 
    - J, Jmod, ACID
- 3D cube files and VTK vti files
    - JVEC, JMOD, ACID
    - JVEC as vector and 3D streamline
    - ACID as surface
    - paraview examples see files.pvsm 
    - open paraview, load pvsm file 
    - paraview needs files.vti as input information
    - note ALL vti files contain data in atomic units
      therefore you need to convert the mol.xyz file from Angstroem
      to bohr
    - note this is not the case for the cube files
- 2D VTK vti file for JVEC
    - visualization as vectors and streamlines LIC
    - note you need to replace NAN in the header of the vti file with zero
    - this needs to be fixed




    Visualizations in ParaView

- In order to view the sample ParaView states, it is necessary to give the path to the jvec.vti file on your computer. This can be done from the directory containing the README file in the following way:

(cd ./2D/ && JVEC=$(pwd) && sedstring="s:@JVEC@:$JVEC/jvec.vti:" && sed "$sedstring" jvec-2d-paraview.pvsm.in > jvec-2d-paraview.pvsm)

NOTE: Please do not forget the brackets. They cause all the commands to be exectued in the same shell.

NOTE 2: If your ParaView is installed under Windows, you need to provide the path manually, and each backslash should be writen three times

( cd ./2D/ && JVEC="C:\\\Users\\\path\\\to\\\jvec.vti" && sedstring=$(echo "s,@JVEC@,$JVEC,g"); echo; echo $sedstring; sed "$sedstring" jvec-2d-paraview.pvsm.in > jvec-2d-paraview.pvsm )
