The new version of the Gimic test script runs tests for two molecules - benzene and cyclobutadiene. The script is executed at the test directory by giving the directory where the binary is located. On my laptop this is:

~/Shared/PhD/gimic/test/gimic-test.sh /home/suzanka/Shared/PhD/gimic-fork/bin

The script executes the calculations in the directories ./benzene/int/ and ./C4H4/int/ for the provided gimic.inp file and writes to gimic.test.out. Then the values for the diatropic paratropic, and the total currents are extracted from the output file and compared to the corresponding value obtained with master version of Gimic that are provided in the file gimic.out. When the difference between these results is less than 1e-5, the script considers it a success and prints 0; else it prints 1. The outcome of all tests are summed and at the end printed on stdout.

In order to test it on another molecule it is necessary to create a directory ./your-molecule/int/ and provide the file gimic.out from a calculation from the master version to use as reference. The name your-molecule should be added to the list of molecules at the end of the script:

molecules="benzene C4H4 your-molecule"

The script will loop over them and give the final test result.

If you want to see more detailed results from the tests - such as the values that were calculated and see which test(s) failed, type -v as the SECOND command-line argument:

~/Shared/PhD/gimic/test/gimic-test.sh /home/suzanka/Shared/PhD/gimic-fork/bin -v

Good luck!
