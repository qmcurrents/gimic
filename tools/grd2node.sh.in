# a short script for preparing the input for 'tetgen' which is a simple
# tetrahedral mesh generator.  The input to this script is a file with grid
# points (no header, one set of xyz per line, ie the number of line is the
# number of grid points).  The output of this script (tetgen's .node format) is
# a very similar file where the first line contains the number of points (and
# ideally/optionally followed by the data tuple length) and every subsequent
# line contains the index of the grid point in the first column followed by
# xyz.

wc -l < $1 > grid.node
awk '{print NR, $1, $2, $3}' $1  >> grid.node
